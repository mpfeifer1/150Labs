This is one of my favorite pieces of code.

I walked in to lab, with one goal in mind. Get out as fast as I could.
During the first 5 minutes TA tells us that this will be a very long
assignment. He told us it's OK if we take it back to work on outside of
class, and bring it to him the next week. Most of the students were afraid
they'd have to spend almost ten hours on it. He finally hands us the spec
sheet. It was one page, front and back. I started writing code as fast as I could. After 20 minutes, I was done. I call over the TA, and I hear all
the other students whispering, "There's no way he has everything right". After
a minute, he says, "yep, looks good". All the other student's minds are blown.
They're all looking at me with their eyes and jaws wide open. The TA asks me,
"how long have you been programming?", I replied, "oh, only about two years".
Then he asks, "How much have you used c++?". I replied, "never.". I say,
"Bye, guys". and start leaving. All the other students were still murmuring,
and as I'm leaving some of them laugh, some are like "how??", and I heard one
guy go "what the HELL?!"

Now everyone either wants my help or hates me :)
