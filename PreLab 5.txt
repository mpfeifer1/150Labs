A. The while loop needs brackets. Without them, it will keep outputting I (1) forever
B. There's a semicolon after while. This will be an infinite loop that does nothing
C. I will keep getting larger, so the condition will always be true, thus an infinite loop
D. J will always be negative, so one will always be true, and an infinite loop

A. Nothing
B. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 +  = 16
C. 12345
D. 6420-2

int i = 1;
do {
    cout << pow(3, i) << " ";
    i++;
} while(i <= 7);

int i = 1;
while(i <= 7) {
    cout << pow(3, i) << " ";
    i++;
}

for(int i = 1; i <= 7; i++) {
    cout << pow(3, i) << " ";
}

Pre-Test:
For, While

Post-Test:
Do While

Textbook Section 8.4 (P. 218-219)
1. For loops use semicolons, not commas
2. There shouldn't be a semicolon directly after the for, and pre-incrementing is generally a little bit more confusing
3. You need to increment count
4. This loop will always be less than 15, so it'll loop forever
5. No. That's just awful. Please just use while(true) if your code's that bad
6. for(i = 0, j = 10; i < 0; i++, j--) {
       cout << i << " " << j << endl;
   }
7. 0 01 012 0123 01234
